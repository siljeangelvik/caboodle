            <h1>SEO basics: <span class="h-contrast">22 essentials you need for optimizing your site</span></h1>

            <h2>What is SEO?</h2>
            <p>Quite simply, SEO is the <u>umbrella</u> term for all the methods you
                can use to ensure the <strong>visibility</strong> of your
                website and its content on <strong>S</strong>earch <strong>E</strong>ngine <strong>R</strong>esults
                <strong>P</strong>ages (SERPs).</p>

            <h2>Why do you need SEO?</h2>
            <p>Building a strong site architecture and providing clear navigation will help search engines index your
                site quickly and easily. This will also, more importantly, provide visitors with a good experience of
                using your site and encourage repeat visits. It’s worth considering that Google is increasingly paying
                attention to user experience.</p>

            <p>When it comes to how much traffic is driven by search engines to your website, the percentage is
                substantial, and perhaps the clearest indicator of the importance of SEO.</p>

            <p>In 2014, Conductor suggested 64% of all web traffic comes from organic search, compared to 2% from
                social, 6% from paid search, 12% direct and 15% from other referral sources.</p>

            <p>Of all organic traffic, in 2015 it was found that Google accounts for more than 90% of global organic
                search traffic. So obviously you need a strong presence on Google SERPs, but how strong?</p>

            <p>Well, according to this study from Advanced Web Ranking (which I’ve trotted out before when discussing
                how to dominate Google) shows that on the first SERP, the top five results account for 67.60% of all
                clicks and the results from six to 10 account for only 3.73%.
            </p>

            <p><strong>It’s therefore vital that your site appears in the top five results.</strong></p>

            <h2>What are search engines looking for?</h2>
            <h3>1) Relevancy</h3>
            <p>Search engines try to provide the most relevant results to a searcher’s query, whether it’s a simple
                answer to the question “how old is Ryan Gosling?” (the answer of which Google will likely provide
                without you having to leave the SERP) to more complicated queries such as “what is the best steak
                restaurant nearest to me?”</p>

            <p>How search engines provide these results is down to their own internal algorithms, which we’ll probably
                never truly determine, but there are factors that you can be certain will influence these results and
                they’re all based around relevancy… For instance: a searcher’s location, their search history, time of
                day/year, etc.</p>

            <h3>2) The quality of your content</h3>
            <p></p>
