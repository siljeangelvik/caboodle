        <h3>HAPPY @ WORK</h3>
        <h5>Companies with happy employees outperform the competition by 20%</h5>
        <p>Make the working space more fun and encourage your employees to let their inner child out!</p>
        <h5>67% of full-time employees with access to free food at work are "extremely" or "very" happy at their current
            job</h5>
        <p>Free snacks or lunch at work are a good opportunity to show your employees that you care about their
            wellbeing</p>
        <h5>Close work friendships boost employee satisfaction by 50%</h5>
        <p>Next time you see your employees giggling around the water cooler, don't scold them but let them build
            friendships at work.</p>
        <h5>A "Wall of Fame" can boost up your employee engagement</h5>
        <p>Having a "Wall of Fame" in your office can be a fun idea. Don't only focus on standard accomplishments but
            also include fun ones, such as "the most coffee drunk in one day" or "the grumpiest person on Monday".</p>
        <h5>Theme days increase fun at work</h5>
        <p>Organizing theme days can bring a lot of joy at work, for example: Hawaiian T-Shirt Thursday or Favourite
            Superhero Friday.</p>
