        <p>"Learning is more than the acquisition of the ability to think;</p>
        <p>it is the acquisition of many specialised abilities</p>
        <p>for thinking about a variety of things."</p>
        <p><strong><em>- Lev Vygotsky</em></strong></p>
        <p>Mind in Society, 1978</p>

        <h4>Subjective reflexology</h4>
        <p>Dualism is reinforced by the fact that a special science, subjective reflexology,</p>
        <p>is admitted as not only possible in the future, but even as inevitable.</p>

            <h3>The Behavioral Immune System</h3>
            <span><em><a
                    href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0963721411402596">SAGE Journals</a></em></span>
            <pre>
            Like many other animals, human beings engage in behavioral defenses against infectious pathogens. The
            behavioral immune system consists of a suite of psychological mechanisms that (a) detect cues connoting
            the presence of infectious pathogens in the immediate environment, (b) trigger disease-relevant
            emotional and cognitive responses, and thus (c) facilitate behavioral avoidance of pathogen infection.
            However, the system responds to an overly general set of superficial cues, which can result in aversive
            responses to things (including people) that pose no actual threat of pathogen infection. In addition,
            the system is flexible, such that more strongly aversive responses occur under conditions in which
            perceivers are (or merely perceive themselves to be) more vulnerable to pathogen infection. Recent
            research reveals many provocative implications—for the experience of disgust, for extraversion and
            social interaction, for xenophobia and other prejudices, and for the origins of cultural differences.

            <p>The uniqueness of the individual comes not from the material world.</p>
            <p>Except for the potential you get at birth, which is life. </p>
            <p>The story itself of every human individual, is also not what makes them unique.</p>
            <p>The story of the response to the story itself is what</p>
            <p>builds the uniqueness, the character, the individual.</p>
            <p>If the feeling of external inadequacy and the lack of internal engagement,<p>
            <p>plus a whole variety of other things, it can become pretty ugly, quick.</p>
            <p>The cure for the individual feeling of hopelessness in society today, is to not care.</p>
            <p>Not care enough about themselves to engage with themselves</p>
            <p>to figure out the why, what, how, where, when.</p>
            <p>Why are you feeling this way?</p>
            <p>What are the benefits of behaving apathetically?</p>
            <p>Quickly figure out How will you handle yourself.</p>
            <p>Where do you want to be?</p>
            <p>When do you want to get there?</p>

            <p>The typical cure today are something that is bad for you, in the long run.</p>
            <p></p>

            <p>The pursuit of meaning</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Is it worth doing what I am about to do?</li>
                <li>Do I <em>really</em> want this?</li>
                <li>Is this going to benefit me in any way?</li>
                <li>Is this going to benefit anyone around me?</li>
                <li>Do something productive willfully</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Do something willfully,</p>
            <p>because that's what you really want, is <strong>your</strong> heaven.</p>
            <p>Do something, voluntarily,</p>
            <p>because that's what you think is nice, is <strong>your</strong> hell.</p>


            <p>Doing something you don't like, will inevitably make you experience more suffer.</p>
            <p>Unless, it is intrinsic.</p>
            <p>Intrinsic motivation involves performing a task because it's personally rewarding to you.</p>
            <p>Extrinsic motivation involves completing a task or exhibiting a behavior because of outside causes</p>
            <p>such as avoiding punishment or receiving a reward.</p>


            <p>If the constant of your choices in life, is equal to meaningless,</p>
            <p>the risk of experiencing inadequacy, sadness, resentment etc..</p>
            <p>Will increase. Universally, it seems like everything is meaningless.</p>
            <p>And it to all of us, it is meaningless. Which is why it's a gift.</p>
            <p>It is only in the meaningless you can find meaning,</p>
